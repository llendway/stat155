Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)        #for visualization and wrangling
library(palmerpenguins)   #for penguins data
```

Load the data so we can see it in the Environment tab. When you first load it, it will say `<Promise>` next to it, but as soon as you use the data, it will be there for you to interact with it. If you need to, start typing `penguins` in the console (and then delete it), and that will also make it show up.

```{r}
data("penguins")
```

First, let's briefly open up the dataset and peruse it.

## Quantitative variable example

Let's examine the distribution of `bill_length_mm` by creating a histogram.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, 
                 fill = "orange")
```

And, let's describe this distribution in terms of shape, center, and spread. In order to do this, we'll likely want to calculate some numbers to be more specific. When describing a distribution, think about trying to tell someone who can't see it what it looks like.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  summarize(bill_mean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            bill_sd = sd(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            bill_median = median(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            bill_IQR = IQR(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Density plots can be nice when we have a lot of data. I'll show one here, even though this is a fairly small dataset.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_density()
```


## Categorical variable example.

Let's examine the distribution of island by creating a bar plot.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar()
```

It is helpful to order them from most to least frequent.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(island))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = NULL,
       title = "The Biscoe Island has the most penguins")
```

I prefer the bars to be horizontal.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = island)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(island)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = NULL,
       title = "The Biscoe Island has the most penguins")
```

We can also create a table, summarizing this information.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
