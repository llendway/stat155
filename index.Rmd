Welcome to STAT 155 at Macalester College, taught by Lisa Lendway. This website is mainly to house our in-class lessons, which are found on the Lessons tab. Other assignments, grades, and feedback will be on the moodle page. 

Please read the [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus_2021_FA.html) to better understand how the course will be conducted. To get up and running with R and RStudio, the main software we will use in the course, go through the [R Basics](https://r-basics.netlify.app/) tutorial.
